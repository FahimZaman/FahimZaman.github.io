Researchers have shown significant correlations among segmented objects in various medical imaging modalities and disease related pathologies. Several studies showed that using hand crafted features for disease prediction neglects the immense possibility to use latent features from deep learning (DL) models which may reduce the overall accuracy of differential diagnosis. However, directly using classification or segmentation models on medical to learn latent features opt out robust feature selection and may lead to overfitting. To fill this gap, we propose a novel feature selection technique using the latent space of a segmentation model that can aid diagnosis. We evaluated our method in differentiating a rare cardiac disease: Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) from the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using echocardiogram videos (echo). TTS can mimic clinical features of STEMI in echo and extremely hard to distinguish. Our approach shows promising results in differential diagnosis of TTS with 82% diagnosis accuracy beating the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Moreover, the robust feature selection technique using LASSO algorithm shows great potential in reducing the redundant features and creates a robust pipeline for short- and long-term disease prognoses in the downstream analysis.
