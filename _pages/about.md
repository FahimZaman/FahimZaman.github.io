I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Iowa. I am actively looking for a full time position in Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Computer Vision/Medical Image Analysis/Data Science/Software Development.

My research interest lies at the intersection of qualitative and quantitative image analysis, bio-mechanics that requires the knowledge of medical image processing, machine learning, deep learning, large language models and statistics. My current research aims at overcoming the challenges associated with medical image segmentation for multiple imaging modalities, such as, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, Pet-CT etc. My research also focuses on developing robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prognosis models using artificial intelligence and large language models. My overarching research goal is to develop low-cost, reliable, fast, and generalizable softwares for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases using 3D medical images. These projects help me to develop and solidate skills on C/C++/Python programming, deep neural network implementation with Pytorch/Tensorflow etc.
