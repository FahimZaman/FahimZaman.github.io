Manual extraction pathophysiological features from non-invasive Echocardiogram videos (echo) for downstream analysis is extremely important in clinical settings. The features can range from different phase duration of cardiac cycles to structural measurements of different sections of the heart. We developed an easy to use windows tool (EchoMeasure) for the physicians to extract these features manually in a fast and efficient manner, which will greatly speed up decision making in urgent clinical setting. EchoMeasure provides 3 options for feature extraction: (1) extracting full cardiac cycle from a given echo (supports '.mp4', '.m4v', '.avi' extensions), (2) extracting diastolic phase and saving the end systolic and diastolic frame indices, (3) measuring structural differences of different sections by measuring relative distances in end systolic and end diastolic frames.
